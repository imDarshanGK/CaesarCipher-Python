# Caesar Cipher in Python üîê

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using a Caesar Cipher.
- Preserves the original case (uppercase/lowercase) of the input message.
- Easy to use with user input.
- Simple Python implementation for educational purposes.

## How It Works
1. **Encryption**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
2. **Decryption**: Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back by the same number of positions.
3. **Case Preservation**: The program retains the original case of the input message, ensuring proper nouns and formatting are preserved.
